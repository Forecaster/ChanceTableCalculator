# ChanceTableCalculator

This is a web application for creating dice tables using weighted results.

I use this to create tables for Fantasy Grounds but it is completely generic and can be used for anything where you need result tables you roll on using dice.

I host this [here](https://towerofawesome.org/chance_table_calculator). On the site is a video I recorded explaining how to use it.

It is 100% Javascript.
